# UniverseSandbox

This repository contains two Unity project directories. First Test contains my initial attempts at the balls-bouncing-in-a-box task, using Unity's Rigidbody physics and Collider collision handlers. I will likely not be continuing to update First Test,  and am just saving it as a reference, but it should produce a working build. ProgrammingTest contains my ongoing work on the task using my own physics and collision handlers.
